# ML-Voice-Recognition_Kolin
The goal of it is to make voice feature which will give the app information about user needs which are to call Hospital, Firefighter, or Police. The end goal is to make a seamless experience for user especially in critical hour so they do not need to push any button. Just say their needs and Kolin will directly head them to the services.

#Notes

The voice recognition features (dataset and model) is made by Daffa Aqilah Sofiyan with the help of Avil to deploy it in the form of Flask
